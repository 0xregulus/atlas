# Documentation Hub

Atlas documentation mirrors what a high-functioning platform org would maintain.

## Contents
- `ADRs/` — architecture decision records (template + examples).
- `diagrams/` — Mermaid/PlantUML sources for architecture views.
- `product/` — strategy narrative, personas, thematic roadmaps.
- `ai-integration.md` — describes how the LangGraph service consumes core/data contracts.
- `api/` — Postman collections + environments for quick endpoint testing.

## How to Contribute
1. Start every major decision with an ADR referencing business drivers.
2. Keep diagrams in source form (Mermaid/PlantUML) and export screenshots for decks.
3. Tie technical artifacts back to customer personas and cost guardrails.

Use this folder to prove consistency between vision, implementation, and operational rigor.

# Product Strategy Narrative

## Vision
Atlas accelerates AI-native SaaS launches by giving teams a ready-to-run platform that blends product workflows, trustworthy data, and governed AI agents.

## Personas
1. **Platform Lead (Priya)** — needs reusable guardrails to support internal product pods.
2. **Head of RevOps (Mason)** — wants AI copilots that can trust enterprise data sources.
3. **Security/GRC (Alex)** — requires auditability, SOC2 evidence, and cost control.

## Value Pillars
- **Velocity:** Golden paths for API, AI, data, and infra reduce idea-to-production time.
- **Governance:** RBAC, audit logs, and cost dashboards prove operational readiness.
- **Insights:** Unified data + AI stack supports both analytics and automation scenarios.

## Launch Story
1. Deliver multi-tenant workspace + billing (core/).
2. Layer in domain-specific RAG copilots (ai/ + data/).
3. Automate operations + governance (automation/ + infra/).

## Success Metrics
- Time to onboard new tenant < 1 hour.
- <5% of AI flows require manual rollback per month.
- Unit cost per tenant stays within plan defined in `COST.md`.
